To run optimizations, install Node

###Grunt Install (incase grunt isn't installed)
```js
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Navigate to main project folder

```js
npm install
grunt deploy
```

There are a few different grunt commands:

```js
grunt css       //css optimizations only
grunt build     //css and JS optimizations
grunt deploy    //css, images, and JS optimizations
```
